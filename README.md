# Implements the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors!

History:
This classic game dates back to the *Han Dinesty*, over **2200** years ago.
The First International Rock-Paper-Scissors Programming Competition 
was held in **1999** and was won by a team called *"Iocaine Powder"*

The Game:
Each player choses a move (simultaneously) from the choices:
rock, paper or scissors. 
If they chose the same move the game is a tie. 
Otherwise:
- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock.

In this program a human plays against an AI. The AI choses randomly
(I promise). The game is repeated N_GAMES times and the human gets
a total score. Each win is worth **+1** points, each loss is worth **-1**.
